The assigned project was to design and code a one-page client website for Client: Fresh Eats.

The main goal of the entire project was to meet the request of the client by creating a well-designed, “easy-to-read”, professional website to sell their meal prep service. 

The project required a serious attention to detail in the area of media queries, which can be a task if not properly educated on the skillset. The objective is to code the mobile site first, and then scale up to the desktop site while adding media queries where necessary. The media queries will allow the site to remain fully responsive regardless of what interface it is viewed on.

There was a source folder provided with particular images and the company's logo, along with color pallette choices.

These were the requirements of the client: 
1. A single page website with the following sections 
  - How It Worx 
  - Choose a Plan 
  - View Our Menu 
  - Login/SignUp

Each section was included in the navigation menu and linked as anchor div links. 
The background utilized a style tile color, textured background or complimenting image. 
The website is fully responsive. 
2 Google Fonts must are linked appropriately. 
Buttons have hover states. 
HEX colors are used for site colors. 
A minimum of 7 images are used.
